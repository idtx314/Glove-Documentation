Youtube is an extremely stable video platform.
Keep original footage (should maybe buy an external)
Multiple short shots edited together to produce a narrative
framing
background context clearing
test the lighting with a test clip
info text is probably easier, but audio could be worth it for some projects.
    Todd's rule: If you need punctuation, you should probably use Audio.

Lighting is critical. If you're doing image processing, realize that you will have to demo the robot in the same light that you designed it to work in.
Willen's wing is great for natural lighting, which is great lighting.

Film and image in the highest quality you can manage.

Time synchronizing is important. Visual start signals that roughly coincide with data capture is helpful. Might structure program with this in mind.


Might include 4 seconds of Title template depending on the context the video is in. For example: Include vid with bumper on youtube, embed at 4 seconds in on portfolio.

Attribute footage that isn't yours.

Good captioning is hard.

If you do time compression, make an OBVIOUS note of it.

Bear in mind that intellectual property is an issue with professional videos.

Triple however long you think it's going to take to get the video produced.
